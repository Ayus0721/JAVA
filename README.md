If java is installed it will return the current version of java otherwise if not then let's get started 

- # Go to browser and search JDK(Java Development Kit)

- Select 'x64 Installer'


- # Do the Setup

- # Copy the path where java is installed

# HOW DOES A CODE WORKS IN JAVA


![image](https://github.com/Ayus0721/JAVA/assets/147092631/1074b3e4-f838-4b2d-aa62-9bb79c438107)

The image provided above tells that there  is three things which comes in use while runing a code in java 
- JDK Java Development Kit
- JRE Java Runtime Environment 
- JVM Java Virtual Machine

# 1) COMPILATION   

- The source code gets compiled by compiler present inside JDK
- And the compiler converts it into Byte code
- <b>NOTE: This Byte code can run on any operating system as long as that system have JRE. This is not possible in C++<br> That is why Java is portable language. </b> 

    
# 2) EXECUTION 

- The Byte code gets converted into Native language (ie. 0 OR 1 )
- This process is done by JVM(Java Virtual Machine .

# BOILERPLATE CODE

- Boilerplate code can be essential for getting started with a new project, providing a foundation, or ensuring consistency across different parts of a codebase.
- In software development, boilerplate code often includes repetitive code for tasks such as setting up configurations, error handling, defining data structures, or implementing standard functionalities.
